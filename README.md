# Custom-Bootstrap-Card
UI/UX Design

## The default Boostrap Card
In its final form, it consists on a main `<div>` using a `.card`class and 3 sub-sections:
An card-header containing a navigation tab
A card-body containing 3 tabs bodies
A static footer

Tab1: A title and a subtitle followed by a two columns block. Clicking an entry on the left must toggle the corresponding image on the right.

Tab2: A centered “Loading..” block. The animated shape must be an inline SVG.

Tab3: Static content
